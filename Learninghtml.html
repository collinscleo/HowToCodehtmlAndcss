<!--In this course, you are going to learn the basics of HTML, CSS and hopefully javascript-->
<!--html is one of the main languages used by developers who create websites-->
<!--It is often paired with CSS (for styling) and javascript (for functionality)-->
<!-- When I enclose text within <!-- and --> <!--as I did at the beginning and end of this sentence, I am utilizing HTML comments.--> 
<!--This method allows me to add comments without directly altering the code, ensuring that my remarks do not affect the code's functionality.-->

<!--This is how you start an HTML file-->
<!DOCTYPE html>
<!--It is recommended to state what language you are writing in next-->
<html lang="en">
  <!--Now we will create a <head></head> block that will contain our metadata-->
  <head>
      <!--next, create a title; the title is important for SEO (Search Engine Optimization). The title will also define the title of a webpage that appears in the browser's title bar or a page's tab.-->
    <title>LearningHtml</title>
    <!--as you already learned, CSS is used for styling, but for CSS to style your site, you need to link your HTML file to the corresponding CSS file.-->
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="Main.css"> <!--(The rel attribute specifies the relationship between the current document and the linked document; 
    and the href attribute specifies the URL of the page the link goes to.)-->
    <script src="Main.js"></script> <!--while we probably won't be using this it is still important to know how to link a javascript file in your HTML code-->
    <!--now we can close off our metadata-->
  </head>
  <!--Next we start the main body of the code-->
<body>
  <!--The <div> tag is a container element in HTML that allows you to group and divide content into logical sections or blocks on a web page.-->
  <!--Now we will create a header-->
<div id="header">
 <!--The <div> tag is a container element in HTML that allows you to group and divide content into logical sections or blocks on a web page.-->
<h1>How to code a website</h1>
</div>
<!--If you want to add a logo/image this is how you can do that-->
  <div id="img"> <!--you want to give the image an id so you can edit it in the CSS file-->
    <input type="image" src="ExampleImage.jpg" alt="ExampleImage" width="100" height="100"> <!--the alt tells the code that if the image is not available to show the words in the "__"-->
    <!--src is the link to the image file-->
  </div>
  <!--why don't we add some buttons to link to other pages or even websites--> 
  <!--there are two types of making HTML buttons, however, I will only be teaching you one of them right now; at the end of this file, I will show you the other method.-->
  <div id="button1"> <!--When styling the CSS the button1 id will edit all of the buttons inclosed in the contaner-->
    <button id="Main button" onclick="window.location.href='OtherSite.html'">Another Page</button> <!--after onclick="window.location.href=" add the link to the page you want to acsess using the button.--> 
    <!--Then if you want to change the text on the button you can edit the words in the arrows >_< -->
