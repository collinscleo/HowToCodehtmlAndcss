<!--In this course, you are going to learn the basics of HTML, CSS and hopefully javascript-->
<!--html is one of the main languages used by developers who create websites-->
<!--It is often paired with CSS (for styling) and javascript (for functionality)-->
<!-- When I enclose text within <!-- and --> <!--as I did at the beginning and end of this sentence, I am utilizing HTML comments.--> 
<!--This method allows me to add comments without directly altering the code, ensuring that my remarks do not affect the code's functionality.-->

<!--This is how you start an HTML file-->
<!DOCTYPE html>
<!--It is recommended to state what language you are writing in next-->
<html lang="en">
  <!--Now we will create a <head></head> block that will contain our metadata-->
  <head>
      <!--next, create a title; the title is important for SEO (Search Engine Optimization). The title will also define the title of a webpage that appears in the browser's title bar or a page's tab.-->
    <title>LearningHtml</title>
    <!--as you already learned, CSS is used for styling, but for CSS to style your site, you need to link your HTML file to the corresponding CSS file.-->
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="Main.css"> <!--(The rel attribute specifies the relationship between the current document and the linked document; 
    and the href attribute specifies the URL of the page the link goes to.)-->
    <script src="Main.js"></script> <!--while we probably wont be using this it is still important to know how to link a javascript file in your html code-->
    <!--now we can close off our metadata-->
  </head>
  <!--Next we start the main body of the code-->
<body>
  <!--The <div> tag is a container element in HTML that allows you to group and divide content into logical sections or blocks on a web page.-->
  <!--Now we will create a header-->
<div id="header">
